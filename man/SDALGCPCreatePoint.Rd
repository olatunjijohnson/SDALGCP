\usage{
SDALGCPCreatePoint(
  my_shp,
  delta,
  weighted = FALSE,
  lambdamax = NULL,
  pop = NULL,
  pop_shp = NULL,
  n = NULL,
  method = 1,
  plot = FALSE,
  rho = NULL,
  giveup = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{my_shp}{An `sf` object of geometry type `POLYGON` or `MULTIPOLYGON`, representing the study region.}

\item{delta}{A positive numeric value indicating the point spacing (for regular grid or minimum distance in SSI).}

\item{weighted}{Logical; if `TRUE`, population-weighted sampling is used (only relevant if `pop` or `pop_shp` is supplied).}

\item{lambdamax}{Optional; maximum intensity for Poisson process in rejection sampling.}

\item{pop}{Optional; numeric vector of population weights associated with the region.}

\item{pop_shp}{Optional; a raster layer of population density to support weighted sampling.}

\item{n}{Optional; number of points to generate (used in uniform and regular grid methods).}

\item{method}{An integer indicating the point generation method: 1 = Simple Sequential Inhibition (SSI), 2 = Uniform sampling, 3 = Regular grid. Default is 1.}

\item{plot}{Logical; if `TRUE`, the generated point pattern is plotted over the region. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{rho}{Optional; packing density for SSI point process. Default is `NULL`.}

\item{giveup}{Optional; number of failed attempts after which SSI sampling stops. Default is `NULL`.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{xy}{A matrix of coordinates (x, y) of the sampled points.}
  \item{n}{Number of sampled points.}
  \item{bound}{The union of the study region polygons, returned as an `sf` object.}
}
}
\description{
Generates spatial point samples (candidate locations) within a polygonal study region for use in spatial statistical models. The function supports only `sf` polygon formats and allows different point generation strategies: Simple Sequential Inhibition (SSI), uniform random sampling, or regular grid.
}
\details{
This function is primarily used internally within the `SDALGCP` framework to generate candidate spatial locations inside a study region.
Available point generation methods include:
\itemize{
  \item Simple Sequential Inhibition via \code{\link{SDALGCPSSIPoint}}
  \item Uniform random sampling via \code{\link{SDALGCPUniformPoint}}
  \item Regular grid via \code{\link{SDALGCPRegularPoint}}
}

If plotting is enabled, the function uses `spatstat.geom::as.owin()` to convert the boundary for plotting.
